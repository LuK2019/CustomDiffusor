ToDo's:
- Implement EMA for model weights during training
EMA Implementation: The use of EMA is a significant enhancement over a standard training loop. It often leads to better generalization in generative models.
Gradient Accumulation: This is particularly useful for training larger models or on hardware with limited memory.
